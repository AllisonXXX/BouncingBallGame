         BOUNCING BALL PROJECT

Description:
The project is a bouncing ball game. The ball is controlled by a plate and if the player fails to catch the ball on the plate before it falls, they lose. 
Practice mode:
   The user can practice their skills by playing without losing, just to get the hang of it. 
   They can exit the practice mode by clicking on level1 button.
   The score increases by 10 points everytime the hits the plate with the ball.
After the practice mode, there are 3 levels with different music and backgrounds for each:
Level 1: the ball moves slowly and the plate is big, making it relatively easy for the player to catch the ball. 
         The player earns 10 points when they bounce the ball back up on the plate.
Level 2: player has to earn 40 points to unlock level 2, the plate is smaller. 
         There is also a candy object that appears for limited time on the window. 
         If the ball hits the object before the time is up then the player earns a lot of points.
Level 3: this level is like the first level, but instead of one ball the user needs to catch 2 bouncing balls. 
Practice mode: the ball never falls 
Instructions:
The player can choose if they want the practice mode or levels by clicking on the button corresponding to either when the game starts.
